# Dummy Handler

This is a handler to be used in place of an actual subsystem handler for development and testing. This can also serve as a reference of what a handler may look like.

The Cargo.toml will have to include the 'common' module defined in the ex3_shared_libs directory so it can refer to the component ids and opcodes used throughout the SC.
