# IPC Server Dev Tool

This is a tool created to act as an IPC server that emits messages based on a number the user enters in the terminal.

i.e. open this and run '1' will send a message of opcode '0' to the shell handler

## Usage

see `scripts/test_dummy_handler` in git

## TODO

- Every opcode should have an 'example' command - this can be used to emit that example command when the associated opcode is entered
