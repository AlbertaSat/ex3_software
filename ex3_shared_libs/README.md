# Shared libraries for Ex-Alta3 code

This repo contains Rust libraries that are shared between the Ground Station (GS) and the On Board Computer (OBC) Flight Software (FSW) for the Ex-Alta 3 mission.

This is intended on being a submodule that exists within both the [obc fsw repo](https://github.com/AlbertaSat/ex3_obc_fsw/tree/main) and the [gs repo](https://github.com/AlbertaSat/ex3_ground_station)
